# ImageLoading
Sample project to demonstrate use of MVVM using Swift UI

ImageLoading is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that demonstrates the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture**. It fetches and displays a list of random users using the public [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/api), presenting a list of users, each with their profile image, name, and address. This project serves as an educational resource for developers looking to understand and implement the MVVM pattern in SwiftUI applications. 

The core UI logic is handled by **SearchViewController**, while data binding and business logic are encapsulated in **SearchViewModel**, promoting a clean separation of concerns. This structure makes the app maintainable, testable, and scalable. By leveraging SwiftUI's declarative syntax, the app ensures a responsive and modern user experience.

The code is structured to promote best practices in iOS development, making it an excellent starting point for beginners. Explore the repository to see how MVVM can be effectively applied in real-world scenarios.
